		I am applying for the Software Development Internship at ClickTime because I am interested in applying my programming skills to the numerous challenging problems that ClickTime faces. I find the resource planning aspect of the software developed at ClickTime fascinating, and would enjoy contributing to such an innovative and insightful aspect of your product. I believe that my skills as a problem solver, team player, and dedicated and hardworking programmer will help me to fit in with the knowledgeable staff and peers that I will be working with and learning from.
		<br><br>
		My prior experience has allowed me to not only develop relevant skills but it has also taught me how to cooperate well with others while programming. At my student job on campus, I have used (and had many frustrating experiences with) other company's web time-sheets, and I know firsthand the importance and benefits of professionally developing a good product. In addition, attending UC Berkeley has led to me to appreciate start-up culture and a fast-paced work environment. Lastly, I think that a fun office atmosphere less than a mile from AT&T Park would be an incredibly enjoyable way for me to spend this summer.

		Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.
		<br><br>
		Best,
		<br>
